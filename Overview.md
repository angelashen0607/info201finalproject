# INFO 201 Final project - Group BA5

## Overview

what major questions are you seeking to answer, and what data will you use to answer those questions?

### Major Questions We Seek to answer
**The correlation between players' ages and wages**

*Because it will be hard for the users to read data from all 18,206 players displayed on the graph, we took a sample of the first 1000 players and made correlation plots accordingly.*

We seek to develop a relationship between **the age and selected ability** & **the wages and selected ability.** While the dots on both graphs represent the average value of each specific group, the lines reveal the positive or negative correlation (ordinary least square) between age/wage and the selected values.

For instance, the dot on the age of 20 represents the average overall score (if overall is the selected value) of players who are 20 years old.
